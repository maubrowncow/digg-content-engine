Audiobooks saved my reading habit. Fight me.

## BODY (Copy this)

```
Barely read anything in my 20s. Too distracted, always something else winning. Thought I just wasn't a "reader" anymore.

Two years ago I tried audiobooks on my commute. 30-something books later, I'm back.

Last year: Project Hail Mary, The Road, Dark Matter (tore through that in two days), Thursday Murder Club, Lonesome Dove, World War Z, Kitchen Confidential, a bunch of others. Currently on Blood Meridian for the heavy stuff, A Man Called Ove when I need something lighter.

Maybe 5 of those were physical. The rest were audiobooks. And every time I mention this, someone points out I didn't "really" read them.

I absorbed every word. Got wrecked by the same plot twists. Thought about the same ideas for days. But because my eyes weren't involved, it doesn't count?

We don't tell people who watch movies with subtitles they "didn't really watch it." But audiobooks are cheating?

I'll die on this hill. If the goal is to experience stories and let books change how you see the world, audiobooks do that.

What's in your ears right now?

## PREPARED RESPONSES

**If someone says "Listening isn't reading":**
```
Semantically, sure. But if we're talking about experiencing a book, the story, the ideas, the impact... does the input method really matter that much? Genuine question.
```

**If someone says "You retain less":**
```
Interesting. I've actually found the opposite for certain books. Dense nonfiction? Yeah, I'll go physical. But narrative fiction with a good narrator? I'm more engaged, not less. Different tools for different books.
```

**If someone asks for audiobook recommendations:**
```
Depends what you're into, but a few that work especially well in audio:
- Project Hail Mary (Ray Porter's narration is perfect)
- Kitchen Confidential (Bourdain reads it himself)
- World War Z (full cast, feels like a documentary)
- Lonesome Dove (36 hours but worth every minute)

What genres do you usually go for?
```

**If someone agrees and shares their list:**
```
Solid list. [Pick one from their list] has been on my queue for a while. Might bump it up. How was the narration?
```

**If someone is hostile:**
```
Fair enough, we can disagree. What got you back into reading? Always curious what works for different people.
