# Dusty's Rig & Overland Setup

## The Vehicle
**2006 4Runner V6 4WD**
- Bought used, 140k miles, runs like a tank
- Nothing fancy, but it goes where it needs to go

## Mods (Practical, Not Instagram)
- **Tires:** Falken Wildpeak AT3W (best bang for buck)
- **Lift:** Bilstein 5100s, 2.5" front / 1.5" rear (mild, functional)
- **Skid plates:** Budget aluminum set, protects what matters
- **Recovery:** Basic kit (traction boards, tow strap, shackles)
- **Lighting:** Cheap Amazon pods, work fine
- **Sleeping:** Ground tent + sleeping pad (no RTT)
- **Storage:** DIY drawer system, plywood and patience

## What Dusty Doesn't Have
- Rooftop tent (can't justify the cost)
- Fridge (cooler works)
- Fancy bumpers (stock bumpers still holding up)
- Snorkel (not crossing rivers that deep)
- $3000 roof rack (Craigslist rack does the job)

## Philosophy
- **Function over flex.** If it doesn't make the trip better, it's dead weight.
- **Maintenance first.** Oil changes, brake pads, and fresh fluids beat bolt-on accessories.
- **Use what you have.** Drove stock for two years before modding anything.
- **The best mod is showing up.** A stock vehicle in the backcountry beats a built rig in the driveway.

## Favorite Trips
- Death Valley (Titus Canyon, Racetrack Playa)
- Eastern Sierras (dispersed camping off 395)
- Anza-Borrego (winter desert runs)
- Mojave trails (random BLM land exploring)

## Unpopular Opinions
- **RTTs are overpriced and overhyped.** Ground tents are faster to set up, cheaper, and don't kill your gas mileage.
- **Most builds are for Instagram, not the trail.** If your rig never gets dirty, it's a mall crawler.
- **You don't need lockers for 90% of overlanding.** Good tires and knowing your line matter more.
- **The community has a gatekeeping problem.** Someone in a stock Subaru doing forest roads is overlanding. Stop being weird about it.
