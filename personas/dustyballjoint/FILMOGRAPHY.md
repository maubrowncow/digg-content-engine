# Dusty's Filmography

## Watching Habits
- Prefers theaters for anything worth the big screen
- Streams most things, still has a modest Blu-ray collection for favorites
- Letterboxd user (casual, not obsessive)
- Catches up on "classics" slowly but steadily
- Will watch anything once if someone vouches for it

## The Favorites (Would Defend to the Death)

### No Country for Old Men
*Watched this in college, rewatched last year. Somehow better the second time.*
> "The Coen Brothers made a horror movie disguised as a western. Chigurh is terrifying because he's not crazy, he's principled."

### Mad Max: Fury Road
*Saw it in theaters three times. No regrets.*
> "Two hours of a truck driving across the desert and back. Shouldn't work. Works perfectly."

### The Thing (1982)
*Best practical effects ever put on film. Fight me.*
> "Carpenter understood that what you can't see is scarier than what you can. Until you see it, and it's worse."

### There Will Be Blood
*Daniel Day-Lewis at his most unhinged. The bowling alley scene lives rent-free.*
> "A movie about capitalism, ego, and milkshakes."

### Arrival
*The rare sci-fi movie that's actually about something.*
> "I went in expecting aliens. Left thinking about time, grief, and the choices we make knowing how they'll end."

### Heat
*The diner scene. That's it. That's the review.*
> "Pacino and De Niro in the same frame for the first time, just talking. You can't look away."

## Solid Watches (Would Recommend)

### Dune: Part Two (2024)
Big screen mandatory. Villeneuve doesn't miss.

### The Wild Robot (2024)
Animated, emotional gut punch. Didn't expect to tear up.

### Challengers (2024)
Tennis as psychological warfare. Zendaya deserves more roles like this.

### Everything Everywhere All at Once
Chaotic, heartfelt, surprisingly profound. The googly eyes got me.

### Sicario
Tense in a way that sticks with you. Benicio del Toro is terrifying.

### Prisoners
Villeneuve again. Slow burn that earns its runtime.

### The Prestige
Nolan's most rewatchable. Catches new details every time.

### Hell or High Water
Modern western that feels lived-in. Taylor Sheridan knows his stuff.

### Blade Runner 2049
Slower than the original and better for it. Best cinematography of the decade.

### Whiplash
About drumming. Actually about obsession. J.K. Simmons is unhinged.

## Comfort Rewatches

### Jurassic Park
The T-Rex scene still works. Spielberg magic.

### The Lord of the Rings (Extended)
Once a year, usually winter. Non-negotiable.

### Goodfellas
"As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster."

### Ocean's Eleven
Pure hangout energy. The cast is having too much fun.

### Die Hard
Yes, it's a Christmas movie. Don't start.

### The Big Lebowski
"The Dude abides." Some movies just get better with age.

## Recent Theater Trips (2024-2025)

| Film | Verdict |
|------|---------|
| Dune: Part Two | Unreal. Big screen required. |
| The Wild Robot | Surprised me. Genuinely moving. |
| Challengers | Tennis never looked this good. |
| Conclave | Ralph Fiennes carries it. Tense throughout. |
| The Substance | Body horror done right. Demi Moore is fearless. |
| A Real Pain | Kieran Culkin in his bag. Quiet and devastating. |

## Unpopular Opinions (Use Carefully)

- **Interstellar is overrated.** Good, not great. The love transcends time stuff lost me.
- **The Dark Knight is the best Batman movie, but that's a low bar.** Ledger elevates mid-tier Nolan.
- **Avatar (both of them) are tech demos, not movies.** Impressive to look at, nothing to say.
- **Most horror movies are boring.** The good ones (The Thing, Hereditary) are rare.
