## The Favorites (Would Recommend to Anyone)

### The Road — Cormac McCarthy 🎧
*Read 3 times. Hits different every time.*
> "First read: bleak as hell. Second: noticed the tenderness. Third: realized it's a love letter disguised as apocalypse fiction."

### Project Hail Mary — Andy Weir 🎧
*Ray Porter's narration is perfect.*
> "Went in blind. Best decision. If you haven't read it, just trust me and start."

### The Stranger — Albert Camus 📖
*Short, punchy, rewired my brain a little.*
> "Read it in one sitting on a camping trip. The desert felt appropriate."

### Lonesome Dove — Larry McMurtry 🎧
*36 hours of audiobook. Worth every minute.*
> "I don't even like westerns. Didn't matter."

### Kitchen Confidential — Anthony Bourdain 🎧
*Bourdain reads it himself. Essential.*
> "Made me want to cook more and take myself less seriously."

## Solid Reads (Enjoyed, Would Discuss)

### All the Light We Cannot See — Anthony Doerr 🎧
Beautiful prose, maybe a touch slow, but the payoff lands.

### The Martian — Andy Weir 🎧
Fun as hell. Lighter than Project Hail Mary but still great.

### Sapiens — Yuval Noah Harari 📖
Dense but rewarding. Had to go physical for this one.

### Atomic Habits — James Clear 🎧
Actually useful, which is rare for self-help.

### 11/22/63 — Stephen King 🎧
Stephen King does time travel. Way better than it sounds.

### The Name of the Wind — Patrick Rothfuss 🎧
Beautiful writing. Will the third book ever come out? Probably not.

### Dune — Frank Herbert 🎧
Finally read it. Get why it's a classic, even if it drags in spots.

### Into the Wild — Jon Krakauer 📖
Conflicted feelings about McCandless, but Krakauer writes it well.

### No Country for Old Men — Cormac McCarthy 🎧
McCarthy again. That man doesn't miss.

### The Midnight Library — Matt Haig 🎧
Cozy existentialism. Went down easy.

## Palette Cleansers (The Fun Stuff)

### Dark Matter — Blake Crouch 🎧
*Tore through this in two days. Couldn't stop.*
> "Sci-fi thriller that actually thrills. The kind of book where you miss your freeway exit."

### A Man Called Ove — Fredrik Backman 🎧
*Grumpy old man with a heart of gold. I felt seen.*
> "Started it expecting fluff. Ended up surprisingly moved."

### World War Z — Max Brooks 🎧
*Full cast audiobook is the way to experience this.*
> "Oral history format is so creative. Nothing like the movie."

### The Thursday Murder Club — Richard Osman 🎧
*Retirement home mystery. Cozy and clever.*
> "Perfect for when you need something that won't wreck you emotionally."

### Jurassic Park — Michael Crichton 🎧
*Finally read the book. It's darker and better than the movie.*
> "Crichton was doing smart sci-fi thrillers before everyone else."

### The Lies of Locke Lamora — Scott Lynch 🎧
*Heist fantasy. Ocean's Eleven meets medieval con artists.*
> "Pure fun. Don't overthink it, just enjoy the ride."
