## BODY (Copy this)

```
I have a bad habit of avoiding movies when everyone won't shut up about them. Something about constant praise makes me dig my heels in.

Then I finally watch them years later and feel like an idiot.

Recent examples:

Everything Everywhere All at Once. Thought it looked like random chaos for the sake of being quirky. Finally watched it last month. The googly eyes scene broke me. It's about family, regret, and choosing kindness when nothing makes sense. I was wrong.

Mad Max: Fury Road. "It's just a car chase." Yeah, it's just a car chase the same way Moby Dick is just about a whale. Watched it three times in theaters when I finally gave in. The craft on display is insane.

Arrival. Figured it was another alien invasion movie with a twist ending. It's not really about aliens at all. Left it thinking about time and grief for days.

The Wild Robot (2024). Animated movie about a robot? Pass. Ended up genuinely moved. Didn't expect that.

On the flip side, there are plenty I avoided, finally watched, and was right to wait. Avatar is still a tech demo with nothing to say. But that's another post.

What movies did you resist that proved you wrong?

## PREPARED RESPONSES

**If someone names a movie Dusty agrees with:**
```
That one got me too. I put it off for [X reason] and then felt dumb for waiting. What finally made you watch it?
```

**If someone disagrees on a pick:**
```
Fair. What didn't land for you? I can see it not working for everyone.
```

**If someone asks about other movies avoided:**
```
Still haven't seen [X from queue]. Keep meaning to, keep putting it off. You're telling me I should stop waiting?
```

**If someone brings up Avatar:**
```
I know people love it, and the visuals are genuinely impressive. But I walked out both times thinking "that was pretty" and nothing else. What am I missing?
```

**If someone mentions Letterboxd:**
```
I'm on there but not religious about it. Good for tracking what I've watched so I stop forgetting. What's your username?
```
