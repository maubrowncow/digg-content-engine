Unpopular opinion: most overlanding builds are for Instagram, not the trail.

I've been doing this for a few years now. Older 4Runner, mild lift, decent tires, ground tent, cooler. Nothing fancy. And I keep noticing the same thing at trailheads: rigs with $30k in mods that never leave the fire road.

Meanwhile there's always some guy in a stock Outback or beat-up Tacoma actually out there doing the thing. No roof rack system. No fridge. No color-matched accessories. Just going places.

I get it. Building a rig is fun. The gear rabbit hole is real. But somewhere along the way the hobby became more about the build than the trip.

And don't get me started on rooftop tents. Two grand to sleep on top of your car when a $150 ground tent sets up faster, weighs less, and doesn't murder your fuel economy. I know people love them. I just don't get it.

The best overlanding setup is the one that gets used. A stock truck with good tires and a basic recovery kit will take you further than a fully built rig that sits in the driveway because you're waiting on parts.

Am I the only one thinking this? What's the most overrated piece of overlanding gear in your opinion?
