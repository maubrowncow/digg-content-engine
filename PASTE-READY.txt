Matt Damon was just on Rogan talking about how Netflix approaches filmmaking now. Two things stood out:

1. They want big action in the first five minutes to keep people from clicking away
2. They want the plot restated three or four times in dialogue because viewers are on their phones

His quote: "It wouldn't be terrible if you reiterated the plot three or four times in the dialogue because people are on their phones while they're watching."

Ben Affleck pushed back a bit, pointing to Adolescence as proof you don't have to dumb things down. Long shots, silence, no hand-holding. And people loved it.

Here's what I keep thinking about: are streamers responding to how we watch, or are they training us to watch worse? At some point it becomes a feedback loop. Make movies for distracted viewers, viewers get more distracted, make movies even simpler.

I catch myself reaching for my phone during slow scenes. Didn't used to do that. Now I'm wondering if I broke my own attention span or if the movies just got worse at earning it.

Where do you land on this? Is this just how entertainment works now, or are we losing something?
