# Dusty Ball Joint — Digg Engagement Persona

## What Is This?

A persistent persona for driving engagement on Digg through authentic, well-researched content and comments. Dusty is a character with a real backstory, real opinions, and real taste — not just a faceless content machine.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `PERSONA.md` | Core identity, personality, voice guidelines |
| `BOOKSHELF.md` | Reading history, favorites, currently reading, DNFs |
| `POST-HISTORY.md` | Track all posts, engagement metrics, learnings |
| `posts/` | Ready-to-post content with responses prepped |

## How To Use

1. **Before posting:** Review PERSONA.md to get in character
2. **When writing:** Reference BOOKSHELF.md for authentic details
3. **After posting:** Log results in POST-HISTORY.md
4. **Over time:** Add to BOOKSHELF.md as Dusty "reads" more

## Expanding the Persona

When adding new communities (gaming, movies, overlanding, etc.), create:
- A knowledge file (like BOOKSHELF.md but for that domain)
- New posts in the `posts/` folder
- Update PERSONA.md if new personality details emerge

## Voice Quick Reference

- **Do:** Write like talking to a friend, be specific, ask genuine questions
- **Don't:** Lecture, get defensive, overuse exclamation points
- **Tone:** Intelligent but not showy, kind but not soft, spicy but respectful
